#### Personal experience

Personally I have worked with Javascript, Typescript, Rust, Python, C/C++, MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Serverless, WebGL, DOM, WebWorkers, Vuej.js, React.js, Cordova, and many other that aren't coming to my mind right now. 

I did frontend development with frameworks, videogame development in the browser and a bit in C++, a lot of backend development with relation databases as well with more event driven architectures with relational and non-relational databases. I worked on USB drivers and binary parsers with Rust too and done some web scrapping. In my free time I develop an actor-like framework and other utilities. ðŸ¤“

I have been software developer ðŸ’», architect ðŸ—’, team lead ðŸ‘«, CTO ðŸ¤º and CEO ðŸ’¼ in the last 4 years, but I will never stop programming! I'm 50% programmer, 50% manager currently ðŸ––.

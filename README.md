### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! It's cool âš¡ that you are here.

Feel free to check whatever you like. Lately I'm working mostly in Rust (Acteur / Amazon Ion Parser) and as a founder/manager/programmer/ in Couragium, my own software development company.

#### Work

If you need any custom development, let me me know or contact Couragium at [https://www.couragium.com/en/contact/](https://www.couragium.com/en/contact/) ðŸ“«. I'm sure we a find the way to help.

We work mostly in Rust and Typescript and can handle very complex and performance sensitive backend and infrastructure as well as complex business scenarios. We do web and phone apps too. Of course, we are all about open source ðŸŒ±. You can check my repositories ðŸ“š and Couragium's ones too in [https://github.com/Couragium/](https://github.com/Couragium/).

#### Open source

If you are looking at any of my projects and have any question ðŸ¤”, feel free to open an issue.

Enjoy the code! ðŸ˜„

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! It's cool that you are here.

Feel free to check whatever you like. Lately I'm working mostly with Rust in the FinTech sector and open source space.

### Open source

If you are looking at any of my projects and have any question, feel free to open an issue.

My main open source projects:

- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/qldb-rs - Driver for the AWS QLDB Ledger/Database
- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/ion-binary-rs - Implementation of Amazon Ion format (a BSON-like format, but better)
- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/acteur-rs (an opinionated actors' framework) 
- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/rsmq-async-rs (RSMQ queue system implementation in Rust)
- [JS] https://github.com/endangeredlanguagesproject/COVID-19/ (donated code for COVID-19 info in endangered languages)
- And other old projects in TypeScript, and even older in JavaScript, that you can find in my repos.

Although lately I'm not having too much time with work and my daughter. So contributions are welcome!

Enjoy the code! ðŸ˜„ 

### Me

Personally I work with Rust as my main language, but I'm fully versed in Javascript and Typescript too. I'm familiar with Python, Go, Ruby, C and C++, etc.  

I'm fully competent using Linux, MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Eventstore, Docker, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Serverless (mostly AWS Lambda), HTML5, DOM, WebWorkers, CSS, etc. I like doing low level stuff like the binary parser/encoder for [Ion](https://github.com/Couragium/ion-binary-rs) and the [QLDB Database driver](https://github.com/Couragium/qldb-rs).  

I've worked occasionally with Kubernetes, WebGL, Vuej.js, React.js, Cordova, and many others that aren't coming to my mind right now. I've used niche FinTech things like ISO 20022, ASN.1, PSD2, etc. 

I did some video game development in the browser and in C++. Hopefully I will be able to continue with it in the future. I worked a bit with USB under Linux, done some web scrapping and toyed with ECS a bit too. In my free time I'm with my family and when I have time, I do some open source code too.

I have been software developer, architect, team lead, CTO and CEO in the last 14 years, but I enjoy coding full time now.

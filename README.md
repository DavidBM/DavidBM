### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! It's cool âš¡ that you are here.

Feel free to check whatever you like. Lately I'm working mostly in Rust (Acteur / Amazon Ion Parser & QLDB driver) and as a programmer in Couragium, which it is software development company that I founded.

#### Work

If you need any custom development, let me know or contact Couragium at [https://www.couragium.com/en/contact/](https://www.couragium.com/en/contact/) ðŸ“«. I'm sure we can find a way to help.

We work mostly in Rust and Typescript and can handle very complex and performance sensitive backend and infrastructure as well as complex business scenarios. We do web and phone apps too. Of course, we are all about open source ðŸŒ±. You can check my repositories ðŸ“š and Couragium's ones too in [https://github.com/Couragium/](https://github.com/Couragium/).

#### Open source

If you are looking at any of my projects and have any question ðŸ¤”, feel free to open an issue.

Enjoy the code! ðŸ˜„

#### Personal experience

Personally I have worked with Javascript, Typescript, Rust, Python, C/C++, MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Serverless, WebGL, DOM, WebWorkers, Vuej.js, React.js, Cordova, and many other that aren't coming to my mind right now. 

I did frontend development with frameworks, videogame development in the browser and a bit in C++, a lot of backend development with relation databases as well with more event driven architectures with relational and non-relational databases. I worked on USB drivers and binary parsers with Rust too and done some web scrapping. In my free time I develop an actor-like framework and other utilities. ðŸ¤“

I have been software developer ðŸ’», architect ðŸ—’, team lead ðŸ‘«, CTO ðŸ¤º and CEO ðŸ’¼ in the last 4 years, but I will never stop programming! I'm 50% programmer, 50% manager currently ðŸ––.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! It's cool that you are here.

Feel free to check whatever you like. Lately I'm working mostly in Rust (Acteur, Amazon Ion Parser & QLDB driver) in the FinTech sector.

### Open source

If you are looking at any of my projects and have any question, feel free to open an issue.

My open source projects:

- [RUST] https://github.com/Couragium/qldb-rs
- [RUST] https://github.com/Couragium/ion-binary-rs
- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/acteur-rs
- [RUST] https://github.com/Couragium/rsmq-async-rs
- [JS] https://github.com/endangeredlanguagesproject/COVID-19/
- And other old projects in TypeScript and JavaScript that you can find in my repos.

Enjoy the code! ðŸ˜„

### Personal

Personally I work with Rust as my main language, but I'm fully versed in Javascript and Typescript too. I'm familiar with Python, Go, Ruby, C and C++.  

I'm fully competent using Linux, MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Eventstore, Docker, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Serverless (mostly AWS Lambda), HTML5, DOM, WebWorkers, CSS, etc. I like doing low level stuff like the binary parser/encoder for Ion and the QLDB Database driver.  

I've worked occasionally with Kubernetes, WebGL, Vuej.js, React.js, Cordova, and many others that aren't coming to my mind right now. I've touched niche things like ISO 20022, ASN.1, PSD2, etc. 

I did frontend development with frameworks, videogame development in the browser and a bit in C++, a lot of backend development with relation databases as well with more event driven architectures with relational and non-relational databases. I worked on USB drivers and binary parsers with Rust too and done some web scrapping. In my free time I do open source code.

I have been software developer ðŸ’», architect ðŸ—’, team lead ðŸ‘«, CTO ðŸ¤º and CEO ðŸ’¼ in the last 4 years, but I will never stop programming!

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! It's cool that you are here.

Feel free to check whatever you like. Lately I'm working mostly with Rust in the FinTech sector and open source space.

### Open source

If you are looking at any of my projects and have any question, feel free to open an issue.

My open source projects:

- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/qldb-rs
- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/ion-binary-rs
- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/acteur-rs
- [RUST] https://github.com/DavidBM/rsmq-async-rs
- [JS] https://github.com/endangeredlanguagesproject/COVID-19/
- And other old projects in TypeScript, and even older in JavaScript, that you can find in my repos.

Enjoy the code! ðŸ˜„ 

### Me

Personally I work with Rust as my main language, but I'm fully versed in Javascript and Typescript too. I'm familiar with Python, Go, Ruby, C and C++, etc.  

I'm fully competent using Linux, MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Eventstore, Docker, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Serverless (mostly AWS Lambda), HTML5, DOM, WebWorkers, CSS, etc. I like doing low level stuff like the binary parser/encoder for [Ion](https://github.com/Couragium/ion-binary-rs) and the [QLDB Database driver](https://github.com/Couragium/qldb-rs).  

I've worked occasionally with Kubernetes, WebGL, Vuej.js, React.js, Cordova, and many others that aren't coming to my mind right now. I've used niche FinTech things like ISO 20022, ASN.1, PSD2, etc. 

I did some videogame development in the browser and in C++. Hopefully I will be able to continue with it in the future. I worked a bit with USB under Linux, done some web scrapping and toyed with ECS a bit too. In my free time I'm with my family and when I have time, I do some open source code too.

I have been software developer, architect, team lead, CTO and CEO in the last 13 years, but I will never stop programming!

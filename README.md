### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome, it's cool âš¡ that you are here.

Feel free to check whatever you want. Lately I'm working mostly in Rust (Acteur / Amazon Ion Parser) and as a founder/manager/programer/ in Couragium.

#### Work

If you need any custom development, let me me know or contact Couragium at [https://www.couragium.com/en/contact/](https://www.couragium.com/en/contact/) ðŸ“«
. 

We work in Rust, Typescript and can handle very complex and performance sensitive backend and infrastructure as well as complex business scenarios. Of course, we are all about open source ðŸŒ±. You can check my repostories ðŸ“š and Couragium's ones too in [https://github.com/Couragium/](https://github.com/Couragium/).

#### Open source

If you ar looking at any of my projects and have any question ðŸ¤”, feel free to open an issue.

Enjoy the code! ðŸ˜„
